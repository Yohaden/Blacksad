WIP of my personnal project using LidarLite device.
The idea is to assemble it on a pan&tilt head, then retreive the distance from the LidarLite, the pan and tilt angles from the head.
With this, calculate x,y,z coordinates and stream them on an OSC protocol.
On the reciver part, get this values and open them in Maya or MotionBuilder.
The idea is to be able to create a point cloud in maya with this cheap solution.
Check on the wiki for more infos.
